### Problem Statement
- You have a need to get outside
- You are new to the area and don’t know where to even find hikes
- Sometimes you just have trouble making up your mind where to go
- Or you would like to find a new hike
- You have specific things you're looking for in a hike or that you want to avoid
- You want one source to find a hike instead of having to Google all the spots
- You also want to be aware of the hike conditions and the difficulty
 
### Solution 
We’ve got an app for that. Choose Your Own Hiking Adventure is your one stop spot to find your next adventure. We can tailor a hike to your interests/needs. We can introduce you to new places. And when you come back from that amazing hike, you can memorialize it in a journal entry so you can remember the thrills later.

### Specific Benefits 
We’ll provide the hikes and information for the user and the interactivity of the app will encourage the user to get outside.
