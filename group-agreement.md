# Group Agreement:

## Communication plan:
We’re all soft-spoken individuals so we agree to work on vocalizing on our opinions while still supporting each other. We’ll check in with each other a few times a day. In the morning before the stand-up, again after lunch, and again

## Conflict plan:
If there’s two people with a problem a 3rd will mediate, and if no resolution, the 2 people will go into a room and argue each other’s point.

## Work plan:
We will spend some time at the beginning of the project writing down all of the tasks we perceive we’ll need. Then we’ll use the gitHub projects page to assign tasks and know when they are complete. When we have our meetings, we’ll discuss the issues we’re working on and what we’ll attach ourselves to next so we can all work on the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML equally.

## Git flow:
Create a development branch, each will make a branch for each feature, push back into development branch. PRs will be reviewed by at least one other person. Either James or Drew will merge requests. And when we have development branch in a working state, we’ll merge this into master.
