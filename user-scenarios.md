Sad Sax Man
Late 30s
Plays Saxophone
Is slightly depressed but with a little motivation will travel to hike locations to play their sax to the wildlife animals which cheers him up.

SSM would love to archive his trips. He would love to be able to upload videos but understands that is a lot to ask so would like to be able to journal compile notes about his trips so he can go back and record at the good locations.

SSM is not a highly technical person and gets overwhelmed by the other hiking sites. He is from the area but never went hiking much as a kid and is getting more into hiking now but not sure how to decide where to go.
