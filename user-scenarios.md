# User Scenarios

_Maude_ just moved to Seattle from the midwest. She comes from flat country so being surrounded by all of the Pacific Northwest mountains is thrilling. She wants to scale all of them! But she doesn't know where to start. Maude moved to Seattle following a miserable divorce. She's not looking for friends. Her dog is all the friends she needs. So she doesn't need to find a group to hike with; she just wants to know where to go. She's young (enough) so she spends a lot of time online and wants to be able to find a hike using her phone.
