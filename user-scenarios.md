# User Scenarios

Sad Sax Man
Late 30s
Plays Saxophone
Is slightly depressed but with a little motivation will travel to hike locations to play their sax to the wildlife animals which cheers him up.

SSM would love to archive his trips. He would love to be able to upload videos but understands that is a lot to ask so would like to be able to journal compile notes about his trips so he can go back and record at the good locations.

SSM is not a highly technical person and gets overwhelmed by the other hiking sites. He is from the area but never went hiking much as a kid and is getting more into hiking now but not sure how to decide where to go.

_Maude_ just moved to Seattle from the midwest. She comes from flat country so being surrounded by all of the Pacific Northwest mountains is thrilling. She wants to scale all of them! But she doesn't know where to start. Maude moved to Seattle following a miserable divorce. She's not looking for friends. Her dog is all the friends she needs. So she doesn't need to find a group to hike with; she just wants to know where to go. She's young (enough) so she spends a lot of time online and wants to be able to find a hike using her phone.
