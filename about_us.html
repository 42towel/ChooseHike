      <p>I grew up in West Seattle and have lived most of my life in the greater Seattle area. With a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Washington most of my professional experience has been in research. Over time I found that the favorite part of my work was scripting data analyses in R and other programming-related tasks, so making the transition into the tech industry seemed like a sound move to make.</p>

      <p>I am currently on track to become a software developer with Microsoft in November. Next I will be taking 301 and then on to C#. I am excited about what I can do with this tech. I am interested in Public Health, Epidemiology, Infectious Disease, Neurology and GIS and their intersection. I am also interested in accessible technology. I want to make research and data more accessible to communities. My grassroots collective recently received a grant to create a social and health provider resource app.</p>

      <p>Originally from St. Louis, Missouri, but I've been living in Seattle for 9 years now. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Radio/TV/Film from Northwestern University. I have worked in the film industry, in social service, in education, and in market research. I have come to coding through the Apprenti program because I was looking for a challenge that could be fun and could open up new employment opportunities.</p>
